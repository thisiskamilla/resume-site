      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        I’m a passionate Junior QA Engineer with hands-on experience in Agile teams, gained during a 6-month project at a real estate startup. With a degree in Computer Science from Europe, I’ve been focused on ensuring product quality through thorough manual testing practices.
      </p>
      <p>
        I take pride in being detail-oriented, organized, and committed to delivering a smooth user experience. I enjoy working closely with developers and product managers to make sure every release meets the highest quality standards.

      <h3>Experience</h3>
      <p>
        During our 1-week sprints with Monday releases, I was responsible for writing, updating, and executing test cases, running full regression cycles, and reporting bugs with clear, actionable descriptions. I worked closely with the development team to troubleshoot issues and ensure timely fixes before deployment.
      </p>
      <p>
        The fast-paced Agile environment taught me how to prioritize tasks, stay focused, and contribute to continuous improvement with every release.
